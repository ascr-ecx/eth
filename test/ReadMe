This directory contains tests for the state and cinema apps.
mkdata.py creates .vti and .vtu's of the Wavelet data.   The executable 
built in the radial subdir creates a vti (or pvti) containing
in which the scalar component variable is the scaled radial distance 
to the center of the volume and the vector variable points away from the 
center. The scaling of the scalar value is sinusoidal based on 
the advancing time. 

cinema and state expect the .vol/.raw format; use the vti2raw script
installed with the pvol project to convert the wavelet.vti and radial.vti
files to that format.
