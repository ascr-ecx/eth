The radial executable creates potentialy time-varying VTI or PVTI files in which
the scalar component variable is the scaled radial distance to the center of the 
volume and the vector variable points away from the center. The scaling of the 
scalar value is sinusoidal based on  the advancing time.  The dataset ranges from 
-1 to 1 in three axes.

Two options are available:

-r x y z     Gives the resolution of the grid in samples (256^3)
-t dt nt     Gives the delta-T and number of timesteps (0, 1)

Run serially, it produces nt files, radial-K.vti for K the number of timesteps.
Run parallel on M processes, it produces radial-K.pvti and radial-K-M.vti for M
the number of timesteps.
