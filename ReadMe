This project contains code for testing various configurations for in-situ visualization.   After cloning,
cd into the root of the source tree (lets call it ROOT) and run:

git submodule update --init --recursive

to load the code for pvol, pvol-icet and pvol-ospray.

Before this can be built, you'll need to download ispc from https://ispc.github.io/downloads.html  
I've been using version 1.9.1   After you've downloaded the tar.gz file, untar it somewhere and put
the root directory of the install in your PATH environment variable.   You should then be able to
type `which ispc` and get the location of the ispc executable.

To build, configure and build pvol-icet and pvol-ospray first.   There are scripts in configs/maverick
which show the cmake setup used to build on Maverick.   cd into each directory, mkdir a build 
subdirectory, cd into it and look at ROOT/config/maverick/{pvol-icet.cmake, pvol-ospray.cmake, 
pvol.cmake} to see the cmake variables you need to consider.   Those are set up to install the 
code in the 'install' subdir of the ROOT directory.
